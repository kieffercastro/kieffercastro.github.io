CPSC 120

*Lab 3

    Lab 3, it gave a really good base for the next
    labs that we did later on in the future. The
    lab also had some problems with it so it showed
    that I always need to check and test my code.

*Lab 7

   For lab 7, part 2, we used a real world example
   for this, which was parking cars. Having time
   limits and restrictions using code showed me 
   that coding can be really useful in real life.

*Lab 9

   Lab 9, part 1, making judges scorings were
   very relatiable to me. I do sports were they
   they use scoresheets like the ones we coded.
   When I saw how it was inputed and outputed
   it gave me a sense of understanding.
